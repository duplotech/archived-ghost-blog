1. "The map is not the territory." Be mindful of what is.  
2. Concentrate without distraction.  
3. Hold opinions without gripping them.  
4. "Invert, always invert." Impose faces on reality and then ask them contentious questions. Interrogate topics from perspectives of distinct cultures, and reframe in diverse contexts.  
5. Use metaphor to sense patterns and generalisations in nature.  
6. Normalize knowledge. Define boundaries and interdependencies, formulate opposites, show interactions. Finally form simple principles out of these patterns and generalisations.  
7. Compose principles into novel ideas.  
8. "Creativity takes courage."  
9. "Show, donâ€™t tell." Visualisation and narrativisation > verbalisation.  
10. Test new ground by lightly stepping on it.
